- Time signitures with accents on downbeat
- Beat subdivision
- log hours practiced
- Hide settings panel when unpaused, and make it appear when you hover over it (to make the bpm text bigger)
- Make resizable, make it so that it will hide settings if below a certain size, and hide the plot if below a certain width
- make inverse sigmoid possible
