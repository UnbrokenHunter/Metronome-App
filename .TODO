- Time signitures with accents on downbeat
- Beat subdivision
- log hours practiced
- Save settings from previous startup
- Hide settings panel when unpaused, and make it appear when you hover over it (to make the bpm text bigger)
- Add Time rewind, to undo growth such that it will continue to go up again afterwords (rather than a fixed offset)
